# üí≠The project: TOP-legacy-todo
This repo is a small assignement from  [the odin project]([https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-class-based-components](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-class-based-components)), which had us build a todo-app with typical features such as adding, deleting, and editing tasks, all while using legacy (class based) ReactJS code. Later I used concepts from other lessons (see "what I learned") to enhance the existing todo app.

# üñ•Ô∏è demo
The project was deployed on Vercel, you can check it out [here](http://top-legacy-todo.vercel.app)!
